 # BigFlow
An extensive corpus for network flow measurement and analysis of massive network activity

### Measurement Architecture
Extracts over 158 features based solely on raw network packet header traces. (Note that some features may be repeated...) <br />
All features are extracted in real-time based on several papers.  <br />
Only features that can be extracted directly from the network packet header is extracted (flags + fields - options) <br />
#### Features set overview

### Classification Architecture
TBD

###### Note that BigFlow input should be generated by [*PCAPNetworkPacketExporter*](https://github.com/viegaseduardo/PcapNetworkPacketExporter) API
